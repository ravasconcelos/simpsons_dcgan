# DC-GAN to generate Simpsons like characters

The Simpsons Faces image dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and saved in Google Drive: https://www.kaggle.com/kostastokis/simpsons-faces

The images were resized to 64x64.

# Experiment 1
The baseline was the work presented by Greg Surma:

The model was converted to Keras.

The Notebook is dcgan_simpsons_experiment1.ipynb.

This is the result:
